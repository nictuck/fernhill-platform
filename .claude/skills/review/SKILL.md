description: Review a pull request the Fernhill way — the tech-reviewer persona runs every REVIEW.md pass in a fresh subagent (security-lead and ux join when relevant), the findings are posted on the PR, and the PR is merged only if an active exception grants merge, checks are green, nothing Important is open and it is not a permission-class change.

## Steps

1. **Collect.** `gh pr view N --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,files,
   author,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,url`; `gh pr diff N`;
   `gh pr checks N`. Find the context the passes need: for `spec`/`intent`
   PRs the intent directory; for `build` PRs the `plan/NNNN-*.md` and the
   platform `spec.md` (`platform_path` from `.sdlc.yaml`).
2. **Classify** as `personas/tech-reviewer.md` describes. If the class is
   `permission`, the verdict is `needs human` regardless of anything else;
   still run the review so the human has findings.
3. **Pre-checks.** Checks must be green (`check`/`ci`); `intent`/`spec`
   PRs must already have the status flipped; `build` PRs must carry an
   approved plan. A failed pre-check is reported and ends the review
   without a merge.
4. **Review in fresh context.** Launch one general-purpose subagent per
   persona, in parallel, each with the full body of its persona file, the
   PR metadata, the diff, and the context from step 1; never your own
   recollection of writing the change:
   - `tech-reviewer` — always.
   - `security-lead` — if enabled and the diff touches dependencies,
     lockfiles, workflows, hooks, settings, functions, auth, tokens or
     network calls.
   - `ux` — if enabled and the diff touches UI files or copy.
   Subagents read; they do not edit.
5. **Post.** Combine the reports verbatim under one header
   `Fernhill review · <personas> · <EX-id | no exception>` and post with
   `gh pr review N --comment --body-file <tmp>`.
6. **Merge decision.** Read `exceptions/*.md` from the platform's
   `origin/main` (`git -C <platform> show origin/main:exceptions/EX-NNN-*.md`).
   Merge iff: an exception is `active`, unexpired, lists this repo and
   grants `merge`; class ≠ `permission`; every verdict is
   `merge`/`clear`/`ship`; zero Important open; checks green. Then:
   `gh pr merge N --squash --delete-branch --body "Merged under EX-NNN after /review: <one line>"`
   (the hook requires the EX id in the command). Otherwise do not merge.
7. **Report**: class, verdicts, Important count, merged or who must act
   and why, with the PR URL.
